For every software developer, before learning the knowledge and skills of software development

0:00:17.500,0:00:22.880
the first and most important thing is to be learn and master a set of development tools

0:00:23.200,0:00:30.300
Because you can not practice the knowledge and skills you have learned, until you have master the development tools.

0:00:30.740,0:00:35.080
To learn Android application development, the first thing to learn is Android Studio.

0:00:35.540,0:00:39.620
Android Studio is the Google's official Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

0:00:40.000,0:00:42.780
for Android app development of all Android devices

0:00:43.140,0:00:46.960
based on IntelliJ IDEA

0:00:47.320,0:00:56.120
On top of IntelliJ's powerful code editor and developer tools, Android Studio offers even more features that enhance your productivity when building Android apps.

0:00:56.460,0:01:00.600
Help developers improve the efficiency of Android application build and development.

0:01:01.000,0:01:10.860
Next, we'll look at how to download, install, and setup Android Studio, and use Android Studio to create the first Android application.

0:01:17.220,0:01:21.540
The Android Developer website is the official download address for Android Studio

0:01:22.100,0:01:28.780
Everyone must remember the address of this website, because in the future study and practice process, will often use this website.

0:01:29.640,0:01:35.080
After opening the Android developer website, you can see a navigation bar at the top of the page.

0:01:35.500,0:01:42.240
Platform is the introduction of Android platform, and next to him is the download page portal of Android Studio.

0:01:42.800,0:01:47.140
Click on the link to access the Android Studio download page.

0:01:47.820,0:01:58.460
After entering the Android Studio download page, the website will automatically recommend the appropriate version of Android Studio to you according to the computer operating system you use. 

0:01:58.940,0:02:06.520
The computer I use is installed with Windows 10 operating system, so the website recommends me the 64-bit version of Windows.

0:02:07.380,0:02:15.180
If you want to download other versions, you can scroll down the web page and see all downloadable versions at the bottom of the web page.

0:02:18.460,0:02:23.320
The downloadable versions listed here are Windows 64-bit and 32-bit versions

0:02:23.860,0:02:28.360
Mac versions, and Linux and Chrome OS versions

0:02:29.020,0:02:37.460
The 64-bit version of Windows provides two downloadable installation packages, EXE executable installation package and ZIP compressed installation package

0:02:38.520,0:02:44.620
Scroll down the web page to see Android Studio's configuration requirements for different operating system environments

0:02:45.480,0:02:48.680
For example, the configuration requirements for the Windows operating system environment are:

0:02:49.080,0:02:52.940
64-bit Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows 10

0:02:53.640,0:02:57.240
Recommended 8GB and minimum 4GB of memory

0:02:57.540,0:03:01.960
Recommended 4GB, minimum 2GB of available hard disk space

0:03:02.160,0:03:05.700
The resolution of the display should be above 1280 X 800

0:03:06.520,0:03:14.460
Now let's go back to the top of the web page and download the version suitable for my computer, that is, the version recommended by the website.

0:03:15.680,0:03:20.180
After clicking the Download button, Android Studio usage restrictions will be displayed

0:03:20.500,0:03:25.560
First, select "I have read and agreed to the above restrictions"

0:03:26.000,0:03:33.460
Then click "DOWNLOAD ANDROID STUDIO FOR WINDOWS" and you will start downloading the Android Studio installation package.

0:03:34.540,0:03:42.120
You can see the download progress bar at the bottom of the web page. After waiting for the download to end, you can start the installation.

0:03:49.100,0:03:55.320
Find the installation package just downloaded in the computer, click to start the program.

0:03:56.740,0:04:01.520
Before the installation file begin to run, Windows will display a security warning

0:04:02.000,0:04:05.640
asking if you want to run the file from the Internet

0:04:05.960,0:04:09.120
After clicking the Run button, the installation file start to run.

0:04:11.280,0:04:17.400
Next, Windows will also give a prompt asking whether the application is allowed to make changes to the system.

0:04:18.460,0:04:23.360
Because my screen recording software cannot record this prompt, I can only tell you about it. 

0:04:23.840,0:04:26.880
When encountering this prompt, it is OK to select Allow

0:04:27.100,0:04:31.740
because the software installation process will definitely involve hard disk writing, registry writing and other work

0:04:32.160,0:04:36.160
so this prompt has no meaning for normally installed software.

0:04:36.820,0:04:41.100
After clicking the Allow button, the Welcome interface will be displayed

0:04:41.380,0:04:45.720
and some precautions before starting the installation will be displayed in the Welcome interface

0:04:46.460,0:04:50.440
Click the Next button directly in this interface to continue the installation.

0:04:50.600,0:04:54.160
After the Welcome interface, there is the Optional Components interface

0:04:54.460,0:04:56.500
with a total of two optional components

0:04:56.780,0:04:59.340
one is the required component Android Studio

0:04:59.720,0:05:02.860
and the other is the optional installation of Android Virtual Devices

0:05:03.420,0:05:07.400
Android Virtual Devices is a virtual machine used to debug Android App.

0:05:07.800,0:05:11.480
In general, there are two ways to debug Android App

0:05:11.680,0:05:16.020
one is to use physical hardware devices and the other is to use virtual machines

0:05:16.200,0:05:19.480
The specific method used is related to everyone's habits

0:05:19.500,0:05:24.520
Some people use virtual machines most of the time and physical hardware devices less of the time

0:05:24.600,0:05:28.480
My personal habit is to use physical hardware equipment most of the time

0:05:28.660,0:05:36.000
In short, this component must be used in the App development process, so you must choose to install this component.

0:05:36.420,0:05:42.880
After selecting the components to be installed, click the Next button to start the next step of installation.

0:05:43.200,0:05:45.660
The next step is to select the installation folder

0:05:46.240,0:05:50.880
By default, Android Studio is installed in the Program File folder

0:05:51.240,0:05:55.780
If you don't want to change to another directory, just click the Next button

0:05:56.080,0:06:02.320
Still for personal reasons, I like install all kinds of tools and software in a separate place

0:06:02.460,0:06:08.260
which is easy for management. Now let's specify an installation folder for it

0:06:16.840,0:06:20.200
After modifying the installation folder, click the Next button.

0:06:20.560,0:06:32.320
Next, you will be prompted whether you need to select a position in the Window Start menu to place Android Studio shortcuts. You can use the default Android Studio

0:06:32.780,0:06:35.940
Here, the configuration OF the installation has been completed

0:06:36.380,0:06:41.960
After clicking the Install button, the installation tool starts copying the files to be installed to the computer

0:06:42.420,0:06:51.980
After the file copy is finished, clicking the Next button will prompt that the installation has been completed and ask whether to start Android Studio directly

0:06:52.220,0:06:56.360
We choose to start directly, and then click the Finish button to finish the installation

0:06:57.240,0:07:02.940
After a moment, a flashing Android Studio process icon appears at the bottom of the screen

0:07:03.320,0:07:10.360
Click this process icon to switch the Android Studio interface that has already started to the front of the screen

0:07:16.660,0:07:26.740
Although we have already completed the installation of Android Studio, but it still need to do some environment setup work before use it.

0:07:27.060,0:07:33.380
The first window of the environment setup job is asks if you want to import the previous configuration.

0:07:33.860,0:07:37.700
If you have installed Android Studio on your computer

0:07:38.060,0:07:41.360
and want to continue using the previous environment configuration

0:07:41.740,0:07:50.420
select Config or installation folder, and then select the previous Android Studio installation directory

0:07:50.700,0:07:55.880
Because we are installing for the first time, we chose Do not imports Setting.

0:07:56.260,0:08:00.760
After clicking the OK button, the Android Studio startup window appears

0:08:00.900,0:08:06.740
After the startup window closes, the Welcome window of the Setup Wizard appears

0:08:07.160,0:08:10.420
Click the Next button to start the configuration.

0:08:10.680,0:08:13.480
Next, you will be prompted to select the installation type

0:08:13.940,0:08:18.580
The Standard type can basically meet most user requirements

0:08:18.840,0:08:27.480
However, in order to let everyone know exactly what configuration work has been done in this process

0:08:28.000,0:08:31.400
we select the Custom type and then click the Next button to continue the configuration

0:08:32.320,0:08:41.300
Next, the JRE installation folder will be prompted, which is the same as we expected, so click the Next button to the next step

0:08:42.340,0:08:46.780
Next, choose the UI theme for Android Studio

0:08:47.040,0:08:53.640
Darcula on the left isa dark theme and Light on the right is a light theme

0:08:54.000,0:08:57.140
My personal habit is to use dark themes

0:08:57.420,0:09:07.460
but the videos recorded under dark themes are not clear enough. In order to facilitate everyone to see the operation steps clearly, I still choose light themes

0:09:07.900,0:09:11.700
In fact, it doesn't matter which theme you choose here

0:09:11.940,0:09:17.500
because you can choose again after Android Studio is launched

0:09:17.760,0:09:22.960
The next step is to choose the installation path for Android SDK and Intel Hardware Virtualization.

0:09:23.200,0:09:30.280
During the development process, we will often check the Android SDK content, especially the Android source code

0:09:30.640,0:09:36.340
so for convenience of use, we also installed the Android SDK to a specified path

0:09:42.940,0:09:48.000
Although we said earlier that the development process will use the virtual machine for debugging

0:09:48.260,0:09:57.700
the installation time of the virtual machine is relatively long. In this step, we choose not to install the virtual machine, and when we use it, we will install it

0:09:57.980,0:10:03.480
After modifying the Android SDK installation directory, click the Next button to continue the setup work

0:10:03.820,0:10:09.420
The next step is to set up the Emulator, which is an Android virtual machine product

0:10:09.800,0:10:20.220
because in the actual use process in the future, these setting information can be readjusted, so you can select the default setting here

0:10:20.760,0:10:28.560
At this point, all the setup work before the first startup has been completed, and the setup wizard will prompt us to check the selected configuration

0:10:28.920,0:10:33.960
If there is something error, you can go back and reset the configuration

0:10:34.320,0:10:39.180
If nothing is error, click Finish to complete the setup

0:10:39.460,0:10:48.200
The following is a long Android SDK download process. The length of this process depends on your network speed and hard disk write speed.

0:10:48.600,0:10:53.000
We will not wait it and jump this video to the nest step.

0:10:53.440,0:11:01.320
After the Android SDK download is completed, you will be prompted for the downloaded Android SDK content and where they were installed.

0:11:01.820,0:11:06.980
After a brief check, click the Finish button to finish the configuration.

0:11:07.180,0:11:16.160
Next, an window will be displayed, prompting whether to use Android Studio to create a new Android project or to open an existing Android project.

0:11:22.840,0:11:27.820
When we first use Android Studio, we will be prompted what we want to do.

0:11:28.120,0:11:31.380
There are a total of six options, the first three are:

0:11:31.620,0:11:33.940
Start a new Android project

0:11:34.200,0:11:36.880
Open an existing Android project

0:11:37.200,0:11:40.580
Pull a project out of the version control server

0:11:40.860,0:11:47.020
Now we choose to start a new Android project. You will be prompted to select a project template.

0:11:47.120,0:11:52.340
As you can see from the window, Android Studio provides many types of project templates.

0:11:52.440,0:11:55.000
I usually choose No Activity template

0:11:55.180,0:12:02.360
because although other project templates will help us build a basic project structure and generate files

0:12:02.660,0:12:10.760
but they need to be changed in actual use. It is better to create them one by one after entering the project.

0:12:10.840,0:12:16.600
Select No Activity and click next. You will be asked to enter basic information about the project.

0:12:16.680,0:12:25.960
Name is the project name, and the format of the name should be as short as possible. This name is the shortcut name applied to the desktop of the device

0:12:26.120,0:12:34.560
so try to control it within three words and use capital letters as the beginning letter of each word to improve recognition

0:12:34.740,0:12:44.060
Package name is the package name of the project. This name is very similar to the package name of a program class, but has more uses than the package name of a program class.

0:12:44.320,0:12:52.200
Since this name is the only sign of App in the device, try not to conflict with other App package names

0:12:52.420,0:12:58.660
and have certain meanings, such as information about your organization and project purpose.

0:12:58.900,0:13:06.620
For example, one of my Android Material demo projects on github is called com.jacob.material

0:13:06.900,0:13:15.640
Save Location is the path to save the project. Remember to get used to using your own defined project path, otherwise it will be very troublesome to manage in the future. 

0:13:15.900,0:13:18.540
We will now specify a save path for this project.

0:13:21.740,0:13:26.780
Language is the programming language used by the project. You can choose Kotlin or Java. 

0:13:27.000,0:13:33.820
Kotlin is Google's main Android development language, but this example chooses Java as the development language for the project.

0:13:34.200,0:13:41.300
The Minimum SDK is the lowest compatible SDK version for the project, with the default API 16: Android 4.1.

0:13:41.560,0:13:49.020
Clicking Help Me Choose will display the current usage of all Android versions and the characteristics of each version. 

0:13:49.400,0:13:59.200
Although about 6% of the devices are still using Android 5 or below, most of these devices are idle or rarely used. 

0:13:59.420,0:14:06.980
Even if they are still in use, they basically do not need to install any new software, so they need not consider these devices at all

0:14:07.220,0:14:10.600
and can directly choose Android 5 as the lowest compatible version.

0:14:11.000,0:14:16.760
Use Legacy Support Libraries means asking if the old version of Android is supported. 

0:14:17.100,0:14:20.580
For a new project, you don't have to choose this item at all.

0:14:21.040,0:14:28.700
After all the information is set, click the Finish button. Android Studio starts creating new projects and enters the IDE environment.

0:14:28.960,0:14:33.540
The Android Studio IDE environment is described in the next video.
